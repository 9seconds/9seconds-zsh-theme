9seconds-zsh-theme
==================

My ZSH theme based on brilliant [AVIT](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/avit.zsh-theme) theme from [Oh My ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh).

It looks like this.

Basically I removed all clutter (I do not want to know a time of the last modification), removed ruby stuff and add support for Python Virtualenv.


Installation
------------

If you want to do it quick, just do it quick

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.github.com/9seconds/9seconds-zsh-theme/master/install.sh | bash
```

and then choose it in your `.zshrc`

```bash
ZSH_THEME="9seconds"
```

And you are done.
